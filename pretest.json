      "question": "What is a covert channel in a computer system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "An authorized method of data communication",
        "b": "An unintended communication path that allows information leakage",
        "c": "A secure encryption mechanism",
        "d": "A firewall rule for access control"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Covert channels do not use authorized communication paths.",
        "b": "Correct. Covert channels exploit unintended paths to leak information indirectly.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Encryption protects data but does not describe covert channels.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Firewalls enforce access control but are not covert channels."
