      "question": "In the storage covert channel simulation, how does the sender encode information?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By encrypting the data before transmission",
        "b": "By modifying access control permissions",
        "c": "By changing the state of a shared database resource",
        "d": "By sending explicit messages to the receiver"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Encryption is not used in storage covert channels.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Permission changes enforce policy but do not encode data.",
        "c": "Correct. Information is encoded by altering the shared storage state.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Covert channels avoid explicit communication."

      "question": "How does the receiver decode information in the storage covert channel?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "By reading encrypted messages",
        "b": "By observing the presence or absence of a shared resource",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. No encrypted messages are exchanged.",

      "question": "Why are timing covert channels difficult to detect in real systems?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They require special hardware",

        "a": "Incorrect. No special hardware is required.",

      "answers": {
        "a": "They prevent covert channel attacks",
        "b": "They encrypt transmitted data",
        "c": "They help infer hidden data transmission by recording system behavior",

      "question": "What conclusion can be drawn when a data transfer is blocked but information is still inferred?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Access control policies are unnecessary",
        "b": "Encryption has failed",
        "c": "Information leakage can occur through unintended system behavior",
